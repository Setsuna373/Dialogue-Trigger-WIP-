# Dialogue-Trigger-WIP-
Dialogue Script utilizing Fungus Plug-in.

Some quests still slightly bugged. Currently works by entering a collider, checking for a key press, before executing the blocks from Fungus's flowchart. Bools are used to keep track of quest dialogue. Other trackers for quests added in. Collaboration effort between me and the tech lead in terms of debugging and adding quest trackers. Microsoft Visual Studios, Unity Engine, and Fungus were used.
